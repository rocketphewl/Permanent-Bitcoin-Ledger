		<h2>Call to Action</h2>
		<h3>Proposal: Establishing Space-Based Bitcoin Core Nodes and Infrastructure</h3>
		<h3>~~~~~</h3>

		<h3>Historical Background</h3>
		<p>The concept of combining space technology with blockchain systems has its roots in the growing need for resilience against global disruptions. Historically, the vulnerability of terrestrial infrastructure to natural disasters, electromagnetic pulses (EMPs), and geopolitical conflicts has driven the push toward decentralized and redundant systems.</p>

		<p>Blockchain, introduced through Bitcoin in 2009, has proven to be a revolutionary technology for decentralization and trustless operations. Concurrently, advancements in space exploration, such as reusable rockets and satellite constellations, have opened new frontiers for deploying critical infrastructure beyond Earth.</p>

		<p>Pioneering efforts like Blockstream's satellite network have already demonstrated the feasibility of broadcasting Bitcoin's blockchain data from space, enhancing accessibility and decentralization. However, these initiatives remain Earth-reliant. This proposal builds on such milestones by envisioning a robust and independent space-based infrastructure capable of supporting Bitcoin's network during catastrophic events and laying the groundwork for interplanetary commerce.</p>

		<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
		<p>This proposal advocates for the establishment of space-based Bitcoin Core nodes and supporting infrastructure as a critical step toward ensuring global financial resilience, technological leadership, and decentralization. This initiative would address existential risks, such as electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks, geopolitical disruptions, and terrestrial environmental risks, while leveraging synergies with existing space operations. Additionally, it positions each recipient as a pioneer in interplanetary commerce and decentralized systems.</p>

		<h3>Objectives</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Enhance Financial Resilience: Establishing Bitcoin nodes in space ensures the continuity of the Bitcoin blockchain in the event of Earth-based disruptions (e.g., EMPs, natural disasters).</li>
			<li>Advance Decentralization: Space-based nodes eliminate dependencies on terrestrial infrastructure, protecting the network from centralized control or state interference.</li>
			<li>Support Interplanetary Commerce: A Bitcoin backbone in space lays the groundwork for future interplanetary financial systems, aligning with Mars and lunar colonization goals.</li>
			<li>Leverage Existing Space Technologies: Integrating Bitcoin infrastructure within Starlink, Blue Origin, and NASA projects creates synergies with existing missions, ensuring cost-effective deployment and operation.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Key Components of the Proposal</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Hardware Requirements: Radiation-hardened, low-power computing devices capable of running Bitcoin Core software.</li>
			<li>Energy Source: Solar panels to provide a continuous power supply, eliminating reliance on terrestrial grids.</li>
			<li>Orbit Strategy: Deploy in low Earth orbit (LEO) to minimize latency while maintaining resilience against terrestrial disruptions.</li>
			<li>Communication: Utilize existing satellite constellations (e.g., Starlink, Kuiper) for blockchain synchronization and global access.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Space-Based Bitcoin Mining</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Deploy ASIC mining rigs on satellites powered by solar energy.</li>
			<li>Advantages: Continuous mining enabled by uninterrupted solar energy, decentralized mining independent of Earth's infrastructure.</li>
			<li>Challenges: Heat dissipation in space, high initial deployment costs.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Integration with Existing Missions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Starlink (SpaceX): Provide Bitcoin blockchain access to remote and underserved areas worldwide, supporting financial inclusion.</li>
			<li>Blue Origin's Orbital Reef: Integrate Bitcoin nodes as part of commercial space station infrastructure to support future interplanetary commerce.</li>
			<li>NASA Missions: Collaborate with NASA's technology development programs to enhance resilience and cybersecurity for blockchain nodes.</li>
		</ul>
